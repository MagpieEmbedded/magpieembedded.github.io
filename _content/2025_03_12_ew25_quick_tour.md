Possibly the quickest tour you will ever see of Embedded World!
There were 7 halls this year, each bigger than a football pitch.
Recording this took 15 minutes and I walked through the halls quickly, not stopping down the many lanes that divide the halls.
Apparently there were over 1200 stands.
Always a great time!
