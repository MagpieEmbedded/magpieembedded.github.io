    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p>
      Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It's
      ease of use and large community make it a great tool for prototyping.
      Communication over serial interfaces, data visualization and machine
      learning can all be achieved with relative simplicity. Our experience in
      combining these elements, and integrating popular unit testing frameworks,
      allows us to design unique systems with confidence.

    <h2>C & C++</h2>
    <p>
      C and C++ are often considered legacy languages, but they continue to be
      unrivalled in many parts of the modern world, particularly in embedded
      systems. Vendors continue to directly support C and C++ via toolchains and
      programming environments. As the Internet of Things (IoT) grows, building
      systems with intelligence at the edge - on small, energy constrained
      devices - will become essential. Magpie Embedded is here to help.

    <h2>Web Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used to make the websites and applications
      that we use on the internet every day. Industry giants such as Facebook
      and Google have made free tooling available for the web which we can
      leverage to build products quickly and effectively. We have designed and
      built products from scratch with these tools, and take great care in using
      only what is needed, providing a lightweight yet solid foundation for you
      to build on.
