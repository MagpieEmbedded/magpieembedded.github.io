  <h1>What we do</h1>
  <div class="child" style="background-color: #3fadb5cc;">
    <h2>Software Solutions</h2>
    <p>
      Magpie Embedded has significant and growing expertise in a range of
      software systems and tools. We understand the full technology stack, and
      work with equal confidence whether soldering components on to a breadboard
      or writing unit and integration tests for a reactive web application. We
      will work with you to understand your problem and the system it is part
      of, aiming to solve your actual needs, rather than just what is in front
      of us.

    <h2>Website Building</h2>
    <p>
      Creating a great first impression on the web is hard, but increasingly
      important. We can help you through every stage from conceptual design to
      purchasing the right custom domain name and serving your content to the
      world! All of our websites are built on open source platforms, meaning
      once you are happy we can hand you the complete project with no strings
      attached. Maintaining and developing your website from then on will be
      completely free.
    </p>

    <h2>Content Creation</h2>
    <p>
      Magpie Embedded is focussed on delivering value to the software and
      engineering community at large. To do that, we are developing content for
      a variety of audiences. We will be producing educational videos on science
      and technology, with tutorials and walkthroughs for embedded systems, and
      looking at famous projects of the past to show what can be learnt. We also
      want to share our internal products, explaining how you can use them and
      how they work.

    <h2>Embedded Systems</h2>
    <p>
      Embedded systems are all around us: phones, cars, medical equipment to
      name a few. When you need to build software that interacts with the real
      world, that's an embedded system! We love working on this blend of
      hardware and software and have the skills to do so on a range of platforms
      and tools. We will work with you to find the right option for you - the
      right blend of capability, production readiness and cost.

    <h2>C & C++</h2>
    <p>
      C and C++ are often considered legacy languages, but they continue to be
      unrivalled in many parts of the modern world, particularly in embedded
      systems. Vendors continue to directly support C and C++ via toolchains and
      programming environments. As the Internet of Things (IoT) grows, building
      systems with intelligence at the edge - on small, energy constrained
      devices - will become essential. Magpie Embedded is here to help.

    <h2>Web Technologies</h2>
    <p>
      HTML, CSS and JavaScript are used to make the websites and applications
      that we use on the internet every day. Industry giants such as Facebook
      and Google have made free tooling available for the web which we can
      leverage to build products quickly and effectively. We have designed and
      built products from scratch with these tools, and take great care in using
      only what is needed, providing a lightweight yet solid foundation for you
      to build on.

    <h2>Python</h2>
    <p>
      Python is one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It's
      ease of use and large community make it a great tool for prototyping.
      Communication over serial interfaces, data visualization and machine
      learning can all be achieved with relative simplicity. Our experience in
      combining these elements, and integrating popular unit testing frameworks,
      allows us to design unique systems with confidence.

    <h2>Rust</h2>
    <p>
      Rust is a newcomer to the systems programming languages space. Originally
      developed by Mozilla for creating a better and safer browser, it has seen
      growth in use and support, including backing from companies such as Google
      and Microsoft.

      and it is production ready for both software and embedded systems. We are
      early adopters of Rust and believe that it will help us deliver better
      value to our clients.

    <h2>Video and Audio</h2>
    <p>
      Like a firm handshake, first interactions with your content should inspire
      trust. That means getting the details right: consistent colour schemes,
      audio without background noise, subtle video editing. We have developed
      skills with industry standard tooling for editing video and audio which we
      can apply to your content. We are also hard at work on a new product for
      consistently beautiful presentations.
