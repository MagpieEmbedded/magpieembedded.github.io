### First Fairytale

This is how you would go about creating a fairytale.

## Step 1: Github

Github is a place where anybody can store projects that they are working on. Mostly this is code but it could be anything you want. It lets you save your files and store them somewhere else in case you want to work from elsewhere or something happense to your computer.

You will need to make an account.

## Step 2: Start writing

This website already exists so once you have permissions to work on it, you can get going.

It is possible to work directly through Firefox/Chrome on the project although a little dodgy so we will have to come up with some way to test that the website isn't broken before a new page is pushed.

## Step 3: Enjoy

It is really easy to add pictures and organise them :)
