### This would be perfect for all our website ideas!

It is a tool called Jekyll which builds the website HTML using a language called Markdown.
Markdown is quite easy to use, you can basically just type it up and add a few special characters to make **bold** characters and *itallic* characters.

This would make it really easy to write up about our fairytales!

I don't have any images yet but it is also really easy to include them.

The whole thing is hosted on Github Pages and you are allowed one page entirely for free per account!
